   Floating-point estimation errors have been a testament to the finite nature of computing. Moreover, the predominance of Floating-point numbers in real-valued computation does not help that fact. Float computations are highly dependent on precision, and in most cases, very high precision calculation is not only not possible but very inefficient. Here, one has no choice but to resort to lower precision computing, which in turn is quite prone to errors. These errors result in inaccurate and sometimes catastrophic results; hence, it is imperative to estimate these errors accurately. This project aims to use Clad, a source transformation AD tool for C++ implemented as a plugin for the C++ compiler Clang, to develop a generic error estimation framework that is not bound to a particular error approximation model. It will allow users to select their preferable estimation logic and automatically generate functions augmented with code for the specified error estimator.
